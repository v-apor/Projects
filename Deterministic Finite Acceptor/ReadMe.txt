This is implementation of Deterministic Finite Acceptor.
Start by executing Driver.

Steps:
1) Define the properties of Automaton. (No of states, start state, final state(s), alphabets and transactions)
2) Give the input string to be processed by the automaton/DFA.

Output:
Accepted!: If the input string is accepted by DFA.
Rejected!: If the input string is rejected by DFA.


Notes:
+ Need to add exception and error handling mechanism.
+ Need to make it more user friendly.
